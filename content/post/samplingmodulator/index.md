Oh how much months i spent on tracing and checking of this module.. Almost everything worked fine except for little problem with external clock mode - it didn't worked.

Resoldered tiny smd transistor pair under opamp bed with new one. Then, found out that it's legs doesnt ring as they shoud; as schematic shows me. I even added small wire and.. Checked one more time and understood that i misread ic number, so i tried to solve non-existing problem. Removed that trace and checked all again...

And...

Sorry, don't have photo, but that pain which i had there - worth adding this post.

Fiunally, all is working well. This 1-year problem finally resoled. Very satisfying!
