      <description>Befaco Sampling Modulator Oh how much months i spent on tracing and checking of this module.. Almost everything worked fine except for little problem with external clock mode - it didn&amp;rsquo;t worked.
Resoldered tiny smd transistor pair under opamp bed with new one. Then, found out that it&amp;rsquo;s legs doesnt ring as they shoud; as schematic shows me. I even added small wire and.. Checked one more time and understood that i misread ic number, so i tried to solve non-existing problem.</description>

      <description>Pre That is probably the most complicated and big item which i repaired in whole electronics career. And im really-really happy with the result!
Internally it consists of 3 different boards - digital part, analog interfaces to outside world and &amp;ldquo;controls&amp;rdquo; board - sliding and rotarry pots, displa etc. It&amp;rsquo;s packed firmly inside, so i had hard time disassembling and assembling it back - lots of effort and only photos of the whole process helped me to put it altogether while assembling.</description>

      <description>Amazing AI Synthesis creates simple, beginner-friendly, beautiful modules and DIY kits which are thoroughly documented and well-designed. I assembled several of those some time before, and now it was time for their most complicated product - Quad VCA, which is completely smd and quite dense.
Actually it is a fix. I assebled module a year ago and didnt manage to successfully run it. Didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough experience with smd to reflow it - so it appeared in the shelf.</description>

      <description>Had this for a while, bought without power supply. Ordered one and check - LED whorks ugly, loud crackles and hisses when moving pots, definitely worth changing it first. Allrighty, lets open it.
Visual I like the complexity colors, quality of build, everything about this board. Says 1986, assebled in Korea - and loots amazingly cool. But lets start. After some visual inspection, i also decded to change all electrolitic capacitors due to its age: fourty years straight</description>

      <description>This will be my first post. I really-really enjoy electronics. It is something magical in process of fixing and building all those electronics things. As I am a musician and long-time-obsessed-with-music-guy, this type of work is a perfect match for me. So,
Broken stuff - visual inspection One of input jacks is definitely broken. It is not regular one, so i tried to find subsittute- and yes! I found it locally.</description>
